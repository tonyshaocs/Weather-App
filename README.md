# Weather-App
A Web Application to report on weather.

I do not take ownership of the assets included.

This web application retrieves information from a free weather API, stored as XML and displays it in a visually appeasing format.

Users are able to search for a city in the format (City,Country) in the search bar and switch from celsius to fahranheit.

No external frameworks or packages were used in this application. JavaScript is used to filter through XML.

This application implements Responsive Web Design for several widths and implemented Asynchronous JavaScript and XML.
